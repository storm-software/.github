<hr />

Storm Software is an open-source software development organization and the creator of Acidic, Storm Stack, and Storm Cloud.

Our mission is to make software development more accessible. Our ideal future is one where anyone can create software without years of prior development experience serving as a barrier to entry. We hope to achieve this via LLMs, generative AI, and intuitive, high-level data modeling and programming languages.
